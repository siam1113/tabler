Hello, Grüezi, Γεια σας. It’s the Tremor team coming to you live from around the globe. We were super busy the last weeks working on our next major release – bringing a bunch of new features people have been asking for a long time. In brief, we are adding:

* Comprehensive global theming via `tailwind.config.js`

* An out-of-the-box darkmode

* A new tremor CLI helping you setting up projects faster

If you encounter any issue, feel free to message us on our [Slack Community](slack) channel.

**Important:** Docs for V2 can be found [here](docs).
