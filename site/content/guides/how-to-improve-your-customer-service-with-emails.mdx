1. **Keep your communication style consistent**
Emails are a big part of your communication with customers. That's why it's important that the emails you send can be easily assosiated with your company. Consistent email layout can be of great help in building an image of your company in your customers' minds. What can help achieve the results you want are email templates that match your company image. They will help you organize the content of the message and make it clear for the recipients. If you don’t have them, take a look at [Tabler Emails](https://tabler.io/emails) - a set over <EmailsCount /> ready-made email templates that will make your work easier.

2. **Build authentic relations**
Email messages are like your business cards, so make sure they help you build authentic relations with the recipients. It’s obviously a more challenging task to achieve online than if you were to contact customers via phone or face to face. But there are some elements of online communication that can help you make up for the verbal contact. Each email should contain your name or username and words like: thank you, please, etc. Also, address the recipients by name, if possible, and be clear about what you want to communicate. Simple savoir-vivre rules can help build good relations with customers online, too.

3. **Ask for feedback**
Even if customers complain about something and are not fully satisfied with the product or service they’ve paid for, try to understand them and provide the answers they need. Offer solutions or ask about their expectations, instead of criticising or rejecting their suggestions straight away. Appreciate customer feedback, even if it’s negative. It will help you fix the areas that apparently don’t work all that well.

4. **Monitor the response time**
Yet another important element of good customer service is short response time. If a customer has to wait long for an answer, or even worse, doesn’t get it at all, they may perceive your company as unreliable and start complaining even more. If they get a quick response, on the other hand, they feel appreciated and so their level of satisfaction goes up. It’s also important to give a dedicated response to every message. Even if you can't find a solution right away, inform the person that you have their problem in mind and they can expect more detailed information in the near future.

5. **Keep the messages concise**
Avoid long emails with very detailed instructions, if they are not absolutely necessary. Scrolling through a long text can be boring, so it might be a better idea to write a short message and share links to longer instructions on your website. Thanks to that, you will spare your customers the trouble of going through a long email, which can be frustrating.

6. **Take care of every detail**
Last but not least – don’t forget about the content. Make sure that your emails are free of bad formatting or language errors. If there is a problem that requires a phone conversation, make sure that your communication style is consistent both in emails and over the phone.

These are the most important elements that you should keep in mind. Thanks to them, your email communication will be high quality and the customer satisfaction will increase. Remember that even if you are to spend a bit more time improving this area of customer service, it will definitely pay off and help you earn your customers' trust.
