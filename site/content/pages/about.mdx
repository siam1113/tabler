Tabler is built and maintained by [Pawe≈Ç Kuna](https://github.com/codecalm) and more than [100 other contributors](https://github.com/tabler/tabler/graphs/contributors). Most new features and components are added to the library based on community feedback - you can participate in discussions about new features on [GitHub](https://github.com/tabler/tabler/discussions).

## Support project

Tabler is an open source project and relies mainly on community support. I would be very pleased if you would be willing to support me in my work whether through contributions or financial support.
